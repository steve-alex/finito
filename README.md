Finito-api is an api for a task management application.
This project was built to answer all the questions I had about building a stable, production-ready API. Along the way, I got to explore lots of new technology and learn some lessons.



Heavily inspired by the following resources -

Funky Featured Include:
* API authentication with JSON Web Tokens through middleware.
* Caching with expensive requests using Redis Cache.
* Cloud database connection using mongoDB Cloud Atlas. 
* Continuous deployment to Heroku when a GitHub action is detected, courtesy of Travis CI and a (fingers cross) passing Jest test suite.
